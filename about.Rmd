# Music
I enjoy playing French Impressionism music from Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel etc. During my undergraduate study, I joined the PKU Piano Association, participated in multiple student concerts, and became the director of Performance department for academic year 2020-2021. The records for these performances are availiable at the [Piano](Piano.html) page.

I am currently following Dr. Svitlana to keep improving my skills.
